# Big Idea 5.4: Crowdsourcing

* We could use crowdsourcing to gather data of the most effective ways to help students. For example, if we asked what method of studying students prefer, we could make a program to enhance the efficiency of that progress in order to benefit the most students possible.
    * If the answer was flashcards, we could code flashcards, if practice tests, then make practice tests, and etc.
* Our project could definitely use some crowdsourcing because it solely relies on user data and we could use some sample data to test our tables with.
* During night at the museum, I will observe which projects attract the biggest crowds, because these projects will most likely be most interesting to the highest amount of students so that I can know what I can code in the future to benefit the most people possible.
