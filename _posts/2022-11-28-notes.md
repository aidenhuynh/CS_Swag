# Variables, Assignments, and Data Abstraction

* Keep variable names simple but not too vague
* Spaces and dashes in variable names are improper syntax
* Variable types:
    - Integers are numbers
    - Text/strings are words (not always)
    - Booleans are data that determine true/false
* Lists can be stored in variables for easy access
* Assigment operator allows programs to change values of a variable
    - = : Sets equal
    - += : Adds right to left
    - -= : Subtracts right from left
    - *= : Multiplies right by left
    - /= : Divides left by right
* Data abstraction represents data in a useful form
    - Variables and lists
* List = Ordered sequence of elements
    - Related items can be treated as a single value
    - Can keep adding elements
    - Store more elements in a single variable
* Element = Individual value in a list with a unique index
* Index = Way to reference the elements in a list or string using natural numbers (you can do negative in Python tho??)
    - AP Exam has it start at 1
* Python allows you to append lists to lists but on the AP Exam it just replaces the other list

# Mathematical Expressions and Strings

* Sequences are the order that algorithms do things
* Selection chooses different outcomes from a decision
* Iteration repeats code until true

* Remainder represented by MOD (% in python)
* Follows same order of operations as regular mathematics
* Numerical values can be stored in variables, as well as other variables, the results of mathematical operations, and results of procedure calls
* Strings can be anything
* Concatenation adds two strings (like just + in python)
* substring(string, starting index, ending index)
    - substring("thisisabruhmoment", 8, 11) returns "bruh" (CollegeBoard index starts at 1)

# Boolean
* If and else and else if
* returns only 2 possible outputs, true or false
* includes <, >, =, !=, etc.
