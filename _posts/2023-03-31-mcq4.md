<details closed>
    <summary>A student is writing a program that is intended to replace each negative value in a particular column of a spreadsheet with the value 0. Which of the following procedures is most likely to be useful in the student’s program?</summary>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Original answer:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>A procedure containsNegatives, which returns true if any negative values appear in the column and returns false otherwise.</li>
            </ul>
        <li><b>Correct answer:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>A procedure findNegative, which returns the row number of the first negative value that appears in the column or -1 if there are no negative values.</li>
            </ul>
        <li><b>Explanation</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Being able to identify if there is a negative and where it is is most beneficial for the intended purpose. The original is incorrect because it returns true for a whole list but doesn't tell you where.</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>

        <li><b>Explanation</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Original answer is wrong because it won't check the very last item in the list. Correct is right because it successfully does check all items.</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
