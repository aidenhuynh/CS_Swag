# Big Idea 5.5: Legal and Ethical Concerns

* License Types
    1. Creative Commons MIT License: Requires authors to be credited, closed source.
    2. Open Source GPL License: Publicly available for all purposes except making closed source versions
* Open source = Public, closed source = private
* Open Source seems best because I don't intend to profit off of my garbage code
* Using GNU General Public License v3.0 because it allows for people to use the code for private and commercial use, but we still get credited.
