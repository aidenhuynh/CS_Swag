# Big Idea 5.1: Beneficial and Harmful Effects

## Notes from lecture
* Drones can be used for good, like search and rescue, but can also be used in bad ways like as military weapons
* ChatGPT is **disruptive**
    - Disruptive: Changes the way that people act
    - Concerns artists, Google (because less searching -> less ads), schools, etc.
    - May return **biased** information, as it only considers one perspective

## Benefits and Harms of our Project
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Benefit</th>
        <th>Harm</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>Easier organization for consumers</li>
                <li>Quickly find items in storage for consumers</li>
                <li>Log-in ensures that storage can not be manipulated by outsiders</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>(Currently) unprotected information that can be used in malicious ways (planning a theft)</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
Note: I tried very hard to change the text color inside here but I can't do that without changing the sass file for the entire fastpages theme (which I don't want to do) so tough luck I guess.

# Big Idea 5.2: Digital Divide

## Notes from lecture
* Our school provides chromebooks but in poorer communities that isn't an option
* Google has access to tons of free software that we don't have

## Pros and Cons of Internet Blockers
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Pros</th>
        <th>Cons</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>Prevents hackers from stealing private information</li>
                <li>Prevents access to harmful websites (malware and such)</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>Blocks needed resources sometimes (youtube, thousands of things in CS, etc.)</li>
                <li>Slower internet speeds</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>

## Digital Divide Concerns
* The fact that we have access to materials that others don't isn't ideal because it makes it harder for those without resources to succeed. However, this is why it must be our mission as more fortunate people to help the less fortunate. This can be achieved through more technological advancement, donation, and other means.
