# Big Idea 5.6: Safe Computing

## Notes
* PII: Personal Identifiable Information
    - General knowledge: Name, email, picture, education, state of residence
    - Linkedin
* Safety practices
    - Multi-factor authentication
    - Encryption
        * Symmetric: One key used to encrypt and decrypt
        * Asymmetric: Public and private keys to prevent unauthorized use
* Harms of the internet
    - Malware/viruses
    - Phishing

## Hacks
1. PII is on all of my projects as they all link to my github which has my full name as the username ([aidenhuynh](https://github.com/aidenhuynh))
2. I feel that PII is beneficial and harmful because I fear about my personal information being leaked to bad people online, but it also makes it easier for employers and college admissions to see my accomplishments.
3. A good password could be a randomly generated string of at least 8 characters to make it harder to be guessed or memorized by hackers. A bad password contains words or personal information, few characters and no symbols or numbers.
4. Symmetric encryption has the user input a key to both hide and unhide their passwords into code. Asymmetric encryption has the user input a public key to encrypt their data and a private key to decrypt it
5. We added security settings to encrypt our data in the AWS servers to prevent attacks
6. Personally, I have never fallen for a phishing scheme because I've grown up being very cautious of this because my parents told me to be. However, I know several friends who have fallen for things like this, for example, people input their instagram account data for more followers, but end up getting their accounts stolen. Other examples include free currencies in games that take your passwords.
