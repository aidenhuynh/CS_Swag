### Performance Task #1
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Row #</th>
        <th>Score</th>
        <th>Explanation</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1/1</td>
        <td>Video clearly showed input as described by written response. Purpose and output clearly met.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1/1</td>
        <td>Named list with multiple elements, which contributes to purpose as shown in code segment where it is used.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>1/1</td>
        <td>Explains how the list makes coding easier and gives an example of how the code would look without the example.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>1/1</td>
        <td>Procedure of at least one parameter has function described and how it contributes to the program purpose.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>1/1</td>
        <td>Algorithm is described as in row 4, and steps are clear enough for replication.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>1/1</td>
        <td>Calls return different values and are described.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td colspan="3">Overall: 6/6</td></tr>
    <tr><td colspan="3">Actual: 4/6</td></tr>
</table>

* For Row 1: The function of the program is described rather than the purpose
* For Row 3: List does not manage complexity, as strings could just be used. I believe complexity is referring to simplifying the code, not the coding process.

### Performance Task #2
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Row #</th>
        <th>Score</th>
        <th>Explanation</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1/1</td>
        <td>Purpose, input, output described and shown.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1/1</td>
        <td>Describes a named list and the data in it. Shows this list contributing to the purpose.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>1/1</td>
        <td>Explains how the list simplifies the code and also shows how the code would be different without the list.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>1/1</td>
        <td>Procedure with at least one parameter is shown being called and contribution to purpose is clear</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>1/1</td>
        <td>Algorithm's steps clearly listed and functions as described in row 4.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>1/1</td>
        <td>Calls return different values and are described.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td colspan="3">Overall: 6/6</td></tr>
    <tr><td colspan="3">Actual: 6/6</td></tr>
