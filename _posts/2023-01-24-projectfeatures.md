# My Contributions

* A search bar to quickly find item names in the table
    - Algorithm/procedure that iterates through the API (list) of item names then selects ones that match the input of the search bar.
* A way to "favorite" items in the table and to only show favorited items in the table
    - Saved in localstorage so they remain favorited for the user
        - localStorage is an object (OOP!)

        <td>The algorithm starts by creating an empty list then uses a for loop that iterates through the list of item names. It first checks if the item name includes the value from the search, and if it returns true, then that item is appended to the new list then it repeats this check for the next item in the list. If this returns false, it immediately moves to the next item. After each item in the list had been indexed, it runs another procedure that changes the table data based on an array parameter, which here we use the new list so that it only uses data of items that matched the search.</td>
