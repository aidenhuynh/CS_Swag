        * Input: Search bar
        * Purpose: To provide users with assistance in finding needed crafting recipes when playing older versions of Minecraft.
        * Output: Desired Minecraft recipes
        * Recipes all stored in a list of dictionaries called *craftables*
            * Manages complexity by allowing procedures to iterate through the list rather than having to check each item in separate lines (for example, the search bar checks the whole craftables list, rather than checking each item in craftables one by one)
        * The procedure named *createRow* takes three parameters and is used to create the crafting grids for specific items. The parameters are "list" (a list of item recipes; *craftables* or a returned list from the search procedure), "index" (index of the desired item in the list), and "rowNum" (which row to create with the procedure, 0-2). It returns html code to be added to the innerHTML of the table body.
            * Procedure is called when adding a recipe to the table through another procedure, *getRecipes*
        * An algorithm is used in the search bar procedure, called *search*, with a for loop to iterate through each item in the list parameter and check if that item's name contains the input within the search bar/text box. If the input is in the item's name, that item is appended to an empty list (*results*). After each item in the list parameter has been checked, the procedure checks if the length of *results* is 0, and if it is, the table is reconstructed to have just the header and a row that says that no results are found. If the length of *results* is greater than zero, the procedure runs *getRecipes(results)* to rebuild the table but only with the items in *results*.
            * This function is called when a key is pressed in the text box.
            * Also checks if the search bar's value is null or blank, at which it just runs *getRecipes(craftables)* for the full list of recipes
