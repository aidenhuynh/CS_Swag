### Score: 47/50

### Question #28
![](../../../../images/mcq1.png)

I chose C and D because I thought that it wasn't A and B. It actually is A because it will follow a diagonal path to the square.



### Question #29
![](../../../../images/mcq2.png)

Very simple question I just miscounted because I was in a rush.



### Question #41
![](../../../../images/mcq3.png)

D is the correct answer because (1, 10) = 2 represents when it equals 20% of the voters. C is wrong is wrong because it includes 20% and 10%.
