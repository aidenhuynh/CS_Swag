#### Performance Task #1
|Row #|Score|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|1|1/1|Video clearly showed input as described by written response. Purpose and output clearly met.|
|2|1/1|Named list with multiple elements, which contributes to purpose as shown in code segment where it is used.|
|3|1/1|Explains how the list makes coding easier and gives an example of how the code would look without the example.|
|4|1/1|Procedure of at least one parameter has function described and how it contributes to the program purpose.|
|5|1/1|Algorithm is described as in row 4, and steps are clear enough for replication.|
|6|1/1|Calls return different values and are described.|
|Overall: 6/6|
|Actual 4/6|
* For Row 1: The function of the program is described rather than the purpose
* For Row 3: List does not manage complexity, as strings could just be used. I believe complexity is referring to simplifying the code, not the coding process.

#### Performance Task #2
|Row #|Score|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|1|1/1|Purpose, input, output described and shown.|
|2|1/1|Describes a named list and the data in it. Shows this list contributing to the purpose.|
|3|1/1|Explains how the list simplifies the code and also shows how the code would be different without the list.|
|4|1/1|Procedure with at least one parameter is shown being called and contribution to purpose is clear|
|5|1/1|Algorithm's steps clearly listed and functions as described in row 4.|
|6|1/1|Calls return different values and are described|
|Overall: 6/6|
|Actual: 6/6|
