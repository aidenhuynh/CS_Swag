            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is ___. | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # Only outputs unique numbers # Curly braces indicative of dictionaries # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # No duplicate values . {1, 2, 3} . Dictionary Example . Below are just some basic features of a dictionary. As always, documentation is always the main source for all the full capablilties. . lover_album = { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Lover&quot;, &quot;artist&quot;: &quot;Taylor Swift&quot;, &quot;year&quot;: 2019, &quot;genre&quot;: [&quot;Pop&quot;, &quot;Synth-pop&quot;], &quot;tracks&quot;: { 1: &quot;I Forgot That You Existed&quot;, 2: &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, 3: &quot;Lover&quot;, 4: &quot;The Man&quot;, 5: &quot;The Archer&quot;, 6: &quot;I Think He Knows&quot;, 7: &quot;Miss Americana &amp; The Heartbreak Prince&quot;, 8: &quot;Paper Rings&quot;, 9: &quot;Cornelia Street&quot;, 10: &quot;Death By A Thousand Cuts&quot;, 11: &quot;London Boy&quot;, 12: &quot;Soon You&#39;ll Get Better (feat.

It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.&gt; Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down.

Which of the following has the greatest potential for compromising a user’s personal privacy? Original answer: | The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user’s computer | . Correct answer: | A group of cookies stored by the user’s Web browser | . Explanation | Cookies may include tons of data about the user, including usernames and passwords to accounts, whereas the IP Address does not have information relating to the user. | . . Q28: Remove first and last two characters of string . Consider the following procedures for string manipulation. Procedure Call Explanation . concat(str1, str2) | Returns a single string consisting of str1 followed by str2. For example, concat(&quot;key&quot;, &quot;board&quot;) returns &quot;keyboard&quot;. | . substring(str, start, length) | Returns a substring of consecutive characters from str, starting with the character at position start and containing length characters. The first character of str is located at position 1. For example, substring(&quot;delivery&quot;, 3, 4) returns &quot;live&quot;. | . len(str) | Returns the number of characters in str. For example, len(&quot;pizza&quot;) returns 5. | . Original answer: | newString ← substring(oldString, 3, len(oldString) - 2) | tempString ← substring(oldString, 3, len(oldString) - 2) newString ← substring(tempString, 1, len(tempString) - 2) | . Correct answer: | newString ← substring(oldString, 3, len(oldString) - 4) | tempString ← substring(oldString, 3, len(oldString) - 2) newString ← substring(tempString, 1, len(tempString) - 2) | . Explanation | The original answer is incorrect because it will only remove the first two characters of the string. The correct answer is right because the substring with second parameter of 3 makes it so the first 2 letters are removed, then the third parameter removes the last 2 by ending at the length of the string minus 4, because 4 characters are removed in total. | . . Q40: Move robot back to starting place . The following grid contains a robot represented as a triangle, which is initially in the bottom-left square of the grid and facing the top of the grid. The robot can move into a white or a gray square but cannot move into a black region. The following code segment implements an algorithm that moves the robot from its initial position to the gray square and facing the top of the grid. When the robot reaches the gray square, it turns around and faces the bottom of the grid. Which of the following changes, if any, should be made to the code segment to move the robot back to its original position in the bottom-left square of the grid and facing toward the bottom of the grid? Original answer: | Interchange the ROTATE_RIGHT and the ROTATE_LEFT blocks. | . Correct answer: | No change is needed; the algorithm is correct as is. | . Explanation | With the original answer, the robot would leave the boundaries. I honestly don&#39;t even know why I picked that because the correct answer is so obviously correct. | . . Q41: Using binary search on list of genetic codes . A large number of genetic codes are stored as binary values in a list. Which one of the following conditions must be true in order for a researcher to obtain the correct result when using a binary search algorithm to determine if a given genetic code is in the list? Original answer: | The genetic codes must be converted from binary to decimal numbers. | . Correct answer: | The list must be sorted based on the genetic code values. | . Explanation | Numerical base does not matter in binary search, as long as they are sorted. | . . Q49: Crowd Flow Simulation . A city planner is using simulation software to study crowd flow out of a large arena after an event has ended. The arena is located in an urban city. Which of the following best describes a limitation of using a simulation for this purpose? Original answer: | The model used by the simulation software cannot be modified once the simulation has been used. | . Correct answer: | The model used by the simulation software often omits details so that it is easier to implement. | . Explanation | Modification is one of the benefits of simulations so I have no idea why I picked this. However, simulations lack complete accuracy because they do not account for every possible factor and thus they are not completely detailed. | . . Q50: Which algorithm runs in a reasonable time . A computer scientist is analyzing four different algorithms used to sort a list. The table below shows the number of steps each algorithm took to sort lists of different sizes. List Size Number of Stepsfor Algorithm A Number of Stepsfor Algorithm B Number of Stepsfor Algorithm C Number of Stepsfor Algorithm D . 1 | 10 | 2 | 1 | 1 | . 2 | 20 | 4 | 2 | 4 | . 3 | 30 | 8 | 6 | 9 | . 4 | 40 | 16 | 24 | 16 | . 5 | 50 | 32 | 120 | 25 | . Based on the values in the table, which of the algorithms appear to run in reasonable time? Select two answers. Original answer: | Algorithm B | Algorithm C | . Correct answer: | Algorithm A | Algorithm D | . Explanation | Misunderstood the question. A and D increase in steps the slowest and thus require less steps than the other two algorithms | . .",

The list being used in section 3bii is called dataList . 3biv) . dataList contains dictionaries corresponding to different items and their properties, including their name, the associated action, the date in which this action occurred, and the quantity of the item. . 3bv) . dataList helps manage complexity because it allows the algorithm (shown in section 3ci), search(list) to compare the input to the names of every item in the list in one loop rather than making individual if statements for every single dictionary inside the list. This is especially useful for when there are a much greater number of items, because without the list, this would require an insane amount of if statements in order to check each item. . 3c) . 3ci) . function search(list) { document.getElementById(&#39;bruh&#39;).innerHTML = &quot; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th style=&#39;width:auto&#39;&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th style=&#39;width:15%&#39;&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th style=&#39;width:15%&#39;&gt;Item&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th style=&#39;width:13%&#39;&gt;Action&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th style=&#39;width:auto; text-align:right&#39;&gt;Quantity&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &quot; results = [] input = document.getElementById(&#39;searchBar&#39;).value.toLowerCase() if (input == &quot;&quot; || input == null) { getItems(dataList) } else { for (let i = 0; i &lt; list.length; i++) { item = list[i][&quot;item&quot;].toLowerCase() if (item.includes(input) == true) { results.push(list[i]) } } if (results.length == 0) { document.getElementById(&#39;bruh&#39;).innerHTML = &quot; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th style=&#39;width:auto&#39;&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th style=&#39;width:15%&#39;&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th style=&#39;width:15%&#39;&gt;Item&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th style=&#39;width:13%&#39;&gt;Action&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th style=&#39;width:auto; text-align:right&#39;&gt;Quantity&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=&#39;5&#39;&gt;&lt;i&gt;No results found.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &quot; getItems(dataList) } else { getItems(results) } } } . 3cii) . searchBar.addEventListener(&quot;keyup&quot;, function() { search(dataList) } ) . 3ciii) . The procedure search(list) takes the input from the search bar and compares it to each element in the list parameter and takes all that match and replaces the data in the table with these matches. . 3civ) . The procedure first sets changes the HTML of the table (this is referred to as bruh in my code) to be nothing but the header, then creates an empty list called results for the items that pass the check and also creates a variable called input which is just the value of the search bar input. The next part is the algorithm, which first checks if the search bar is empty, in which it just returns the whole list. If the search bar is not empty, it iterates through each dictionary inside of the list parameter. If the value of the item key includes the input variable, then the dictionary is appended to the results list, otherwise, the algorithm simply moves on to the next dictionary in the list, and repeats this process until each dictionary in list has been checked. After, the algorithm checks if the length of results is zero, to account for there being no matches to the search. In this case, all of the data is displayed again with a note that says there were no matches. For when the length of results is not zero, a row is created and added to the innerHTML of the table for each item in results. . 3d) . 3di) . First call: Typing “pencils” into the search bar . Second call: Typing “cars” into the search bar . 3dii) . The first call is testing for when the search matches an item in the list. .

The second call causes the table to show every item in the list with a note at the top that says that there were no matches. .",

Age difference between users of social media platforms TikTok mostly used by 10-19 year olds (32.5% of users) and least used by 50+ year olds (7.1%) | Facebook mostly used by 25-34 year olds (23.7%) and least used by 13-17 year olds (3.9%) I wouldn’t say that these platforms exclude certain groups, but rather are simply better fit for the respective groups. TikTok is more popular because the younger generations benefit from more fast-paced video media that can be quickly and easily consumed | Facebook is more popular with the older generations because the fast paced media in TikTok is too densely packed with information to be fully understood (fluid intelligence begins to drop off) | . | . | . | Virtual assistants have primarily female voices because women are more prototypically seen as caring for others and in assistant roles in workplaces. This is problematic because it further enforces gender roles that push women into roles that make them seem inferior to men (assisting men) | This may be more beneficial for business because following this stereotype may cause more satisfaction among users because it is what they are useful | . | Algorithms that influence my decisions: YouTube: Recommends me videos that alter my opinions (movie/game reviews) | Recommends videos that affect my mood Things I dislike more likely to get interaction (comments) | . | . | Google: Search algorithm gives me information that may or may not be credible | . | . | . Video: HP computers are racist . The owner probably doesn’t think it’s intentional but plays it off as more of a joke If they seriously thought this was a problem they would have a much more serious tone than laughing about it | . | This was likely caused by a lack of testing for people of color because it perfectly follows the white person’s face. Probably more white people available in the workplace for testing it | Could be fixed by using a more representative pool of testers | . | This is harmful because it excludes a group of people from fully utilizing the features of the device Not intended though, as HP wouldn’t exclude a group because that would be detrimental to their image and business. Yes it should be fixed for the above reasons | . | . | . Conclusion . It is imperative that computing bias is minimized for all applications for several reasons. For one, computer bias affects the profitability of a program because making a program unusable or less optimized for a certain group reduces the possible amount of consumers and therefore reduces the possible profit. Additionally, if users find out about a difference in program performance between certain groups of people, there will be backlash from consumers that will also harm profits, even if the error was unintentional. Aside from profits, this is also important from a moral perspective because it is simply common sense to not exclude groups of people based on factors like race, as seen in the HP computer video. .",

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to help students understand how to make an efficient program and optimize it and understand its importance to the CSP curriculum. . What is Algorithmic Efficiency? . What is Algorithmic Efficiency? The ability of an algorithm to solve a problem in an efficient way | An efficient algorithm solves a problem quickly and with a minimum amount of resources, such as time and memory. | . | How do we determine if an algorithm is efficient or not? One way we can do this is by determining the time complexity of the algorithm | Another way is through space complexity | . | . Traveling Merchant Problem Hacks: . What did you and your team discuss? (record below) . An heuristic solution is an approach to a problem that produces a solution that isn&#39;t necessarily optimal but can be used when normal methods take forever | . Describe the method used to solve the traveling merchant problem. (record below) . Go to closest unvisited city. . 3.18: Undecidable Problems . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Key vocabulary: . Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A decidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An undecidable problem problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(26)) print(divideThirteen(30)) . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): # Testing if the number is an integer if n%1 ==0: return True else: return False # Using while loop to keep searching an a non-integer above 1. Note that the computer runs forever. while i == 0: number += 1 if integerTest(number) == False: i +=1 print(&quot;Done&quot;) . The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an undecidable problem. It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is no way to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . Halting Problem Example: . HaltChecker analyzes the program, program P, and its input, input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the code runs forever, so HaltChecker returns an output of “never”. | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is “halts”. It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of “never”. | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. | . This Diagram Sums up the Entire Process in the Bulleted List: . Credits of diagram and example to Khan Academy . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice . Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems. The entire Halting Problem example was to prove that computers cannot solve undecidable problems. | . Hacks . Come up with one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem.

So, what is a simulation anyway? . A simulation is a tested scenario used for viewing results/outputs to prepare for them in real world situations . | These can be used for games like dice rolling, spinners, etc . | These can be used for practical things such as building structures, testing car crashes, and other things before engaging in them in the real world . | These simulations can have the option of obeying real world physics (Gravity, collision) or they can go against these norms since this is a fictitious scenario, and couldn&#39;t happen in real life . | . Big Question . Which of the following simulations could be the LEAST useful? . | A retailer trying to identify which products sold the most . | A restaurant determining the efficiency of robots | An insurance company studying the rain impact of cars | A sports bike company studying design changes to their new bike design | . If you guessed a bike company, you&#39;re wrong, because the retail simulation was the right answer.

Given a height and a weight, they calculate how long it will take for a object to fall to the ground in a vacuum subjected to normal Earth levels of gravity. . However, the second one is a simulation. It calculates the distance the object has fallen every 0.1 seconds. This is useful for if you wanted a visual representation of a falling object, which pure math can&#39;t do as smoothly. . height = float(input(&quot;height in meters?&quot;)) weight = input(&quot;weight in pounds?&quot;) stuff = (2 * (height / 9.8))**(1/2) print(&quot;It will take&quot;, stuff,&quot;seconds for an object that weighs&quot;,weight,&quot;pounds&quot;,&quot;to fall &quot;,height,&quot;meters in a vacuum&quot;) . t = 0 g = 0 d = 0 false = True while false: t = t + 0.1 d = 9.8 / 2 * (t**2) if d &gt;= height: false = False #print(d) # if you want to print the distance every time it calculates it. Too long to output to a terminal, but this could be useful to display graphically. #print(t) print(t) print(d) . Simulation 2: . This simulation is made in order to simulate movement on a 2d plane vs a 3d plane. . | How it works: we have multiple variables, if statements and equations under a while command in order to randomy generate steps on a 2d plane. Once it reaches the set destination, it will say that the man made it home after x amount of steps. . | For the 3D plane, it takes a lot longer due to how big and open the 3d environment is, so there are more if statements in the 3d plane . | .

Simulations in the wild . Simulations are used extremely frequently in real life applications. One of the most common examples of simulations are video games. A games physics engine can accurately simulate objects colliding . Another example is Blender, the software used in 3d animations class, here at Del Norte. Blender is made up of many small simulations, but one big one it uses is simulating the way light bounces off of and interacts with objects. . HW !!! . Create a simulation. It can be anything, just has to simulate something. . Some ideas: . Two objects colliding | Gravity on other planets | . AND . Find an example of a simulation in a software/game you use, screenshot, and explain how it is a simulation . Hacks . Other simulation: Gacha Games . I used to play gacha games (I know at least one of you know what they are), and pulling in gacha games simulates drawing from a real-world gachapon machine, but rather than selecting randomly from a pool a set number of rewards (set number of toys in machine), this is simulated by changing the odds of pulling certain rewards (good things are 0.0000001% chance because capitalism). . Simple Projectile Motion Simulator .

A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable | .

Picking a ___ name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. . What would be a good name for this procedure? | What parameters do we need for this procedure? | Try writing this procedure out in python based on the given pseudocode | . def retakeGrader(currentPoints, quizGrade, questions): print(&#39;Your original grade was: &#39; + str(grade) + &#39;%&#39;) currentGrade = currentPoints / questions currentGrade = currentGrade * 100 if currentGrade &gt; quizGrade: quizGrade = currentGrade print(&#39;Your new grade is: &#39; + str(quizGrade) + &#39;%&#39;) else: print(&#39;Your grade did not change&#39;) pts = int(input(&#39;How many points did you get? (on the retake)&#39;)) grade = int(input(&#39;What was your original grade? (percent)&#39;)) qs = int(input(&#39;How many questions were on the retake?&#39;)) retakeGrader(pts, grade, qs) . Your original grade was: 80% Your new grade is: 90.0% . Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing complexity in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modularity | A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | . Complexity Example . One of the biggest advantages of procedural abstraction is managing complexity. . Think about the process of simplifying the code? What do you think the advantage of the code segment on the left is? . Code Segment 1 Code Segment 2 . ROTATE_LEFT() | detourLeft() | .

The lesson will start off with introducing what algorithms are and what they do, moreover, what their significance is. . 3.9 Lesson 1 has the objective to teach the student of the outcome of similar algorithmic concepts and similar algorithms. In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed. . Lesson 1 | Defining Algorithms . What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed through CODE. There are set limitations, this is what makes algorithms fun, you can your imagination and create whatever you wan with your own instructions! . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks . | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results. . | Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA) . | Different algorithms can be developed or use to solve the same problem. . | . Example 1 | What happens if we test the algorithm with different outputs? . The pseudocode above is translated to python for you. . Record what your outputs are when you enter 95 degrees F, does the algorithm yield the same result? . The conditional below is nested . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then 95, what do you notice? . It&#39;s too hot outside! . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then Input 95, what do you notice? . It&#39;s too hot outside! Sure I will play outside! . NOW RECORD with another output . Record what your outputs are when you enter 54, does the algorithm yield the same result this time? . *Now use 95 as an input for the two code blocks above. . Even though an algorithm&#39;s code can look the same, you have to be careful, they can always yield different results. When constructing algorithms you want to make sure that your code corresponds with what you want as your output. You set the limit of your code and you decide what the code&#39;s output is. . Conditionals vs. Booleans . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. . Exercise . Learning how to utilize conditionals and booleans are important for developing algorithms. Use this exercise to help you. . Can either Boolean expression on the right replace the conditional on the left? Assume isWeekday and isHoliday are Boolean variables. . *NOTE = you can edit the variables to check the conditions needed! . IsHoliday = False IsWeekday = True if IsHoliday: driveWork = True else: if IsWeekday: driveWork = True else: driveWork = False print(driveWork) . Logically thinking about conditionals and booleans . Now the problem may seem confusing, but the best way to develop an algorithm is to think about all the possible results that can be potentially be outputted. . So if IsHoliday is set to true, then driveWork is automatically equal to false and it does not matter what value of isWeekday is. This must mean that one of the conditionals must be NOT IsHoliday. . In the case that lets say IsHoliday is set to false, then the variable for weekday needs to be checked. If it&#39;s true then driveWork is true, if it&#39;s false then driveWork is false. This must mean that the other conditional isWeekday. . Combining both conditionals, you get option 2, which is not IsHoliday and IsWeekday. This is why option 2 is right! . Example 3 | Conditionals vs Booleans . The following algorithms are intended to sum the odd numbers from 1-9. Which algorithms work as intended? . Below, I have translated the block code into python, import this to your jupyter notebook and record the result. What do you notice? . First block . sum = 1 counter = 3 #iteration var = 0 while (var &lt; 4): #while the var is &lt;= 4, it executes those commands, once it exceeds it hits the else command sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 var = var + 1 # now go through the whole thing 4 times, this is an iteration, a vital part of algorithms. else: print(sum) . 25 . Second block . sum = 0 counter = 9 #iteration while (counter &gt;= 1): sum = sum + counter counter = counter - 2 print(sum) . 25 . When we start our initializing left sum as 1 counter as 3 we had no iterations yet. Remember we&#39;re going to have to repeat this four times because the block code prompts us to repeat 4 times, so we iterate. So as we go through and follow what the block gives us. . So you see that the sum does work, it does sum up the odd numbers from 1-9 . Now lets look at the right block. . Sum is set to 0 Counter is set to 9 We must repeat until the counter &lt; 1 is true. . So we keep adding until -1, that is when the counter &lt; 1 is true, so we stop . So why is it important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same task? . An algorithm is beautiful that way, just because you think of solving a problem differently, doesn&#39;t mean your wrong, . 3.9 Part 2 . Flowcharts . Flowcharts can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm . | They are a good way to double check whether or not your algorithm is achieving its purpose . | . How To Set Up A Flowchart . label the start point . | Define any and all variables you may need . | Consider the first question you want the algorithm to ask . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is yes (or true) . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is no (or false) . Steps 3-5 are the steps to creating code that uses a process called selection (you can convert the question from step 3 to a conditional if-statement in code) | . | Write out all necessary steps for the algorithm to function properly . | You may want your algorithm to iterate some steps until a condition is met . You can write the steps that need to be repeated, then draw an arrow from the last step to a step above that contains a conditional statement | . | determine a way to reach the end goal | Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes . Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen . | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen . | Ex: see Example A . | . | . | Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied . Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced . | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement . | . | . | . Example A . Consider this situation: . You are shopping for your favorite food at your favorite supermarket . | You see that there is a sale on wheat products for 35% off . | There is another sale on produce for 20% off . | These sales are mutually exclusive . | Tax on all items is 8% . | . | Your TASK: . Create a flowchart for an algorithm that can be used to calculate the cost of your favorite item | . | . Example A Possible Solution (using Selection) . 3.9 Part 3 . For Algorithms How to combine and/or modify an existing algorithm. | . | . Benefits of combining algorithms can reduce development time, testing time, and simplify the identification of errors. | . | . Example in Class . Rules . step/rule 1: start with any positive integer | step/rule 2: if the preceding term is even; divide by 2 | step/rule 3: if the preceding term is odd; multiply by 3 and add 1 | step/rule 4: repeat steps until you arrive at 1 | fact: the sequence should ALWAYS end up at 1 if repeated. | . Algorithm to Start (Determining Whether a Number is Even or Odd) . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) print(varx) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx /= 2 else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 print(varx) # Run this cell to see how it works . choose value for x 32 16.0 8.0 4.0 2.0 1.0 .

Step 2 . step/rule 4; here we add the loop | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx = varx/2 # Change print to the function else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 # Change print to the function print(varx) . Step 3 . Display all values throughout the algorithm | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) print(varx) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx = varx/2 print(varx) # add Display else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 print(varx) # add Display print(varx) # Final # Should be 1 every time . Takeaways . You can use code you&#39;ve previously wrote in order to make a project easier. | Breaking algorithms down into steps can make things easier and more simple. | . Hacks . create another algorithm using a famous mathematical algorithm such as the &quot;collatz conjecture.&quot; and explain your steps in a post on a blog. | . 3.11 Binary Search . Goals/Objectives: . detirmine number of iterations required to find vlue in data set. | explain requirements for binary search | . What is Binary Search? . Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. | An algorithm for iterating to find a value inside a data set | . About Binary Search: . Binary Search Algorithm starts in the middle of a data set of numbers and eliminates half the data. This process reapeats until the desired value is found or until all elements have been eliminated. | In order to use binary search effectivly and properly, data must be stored in order | COLLEGE BOARD INDEX STARTS AT 1 NOT 0 | . Think about how you would you would try to find a certain number in this set. . (IMAGE HERE) . One way would be to line up the numbers and count them individually untill you find the desired value. . When working with large data sets with lots of numbers, methods like these wont work . Instead, a Binary Search would be more effective. | . (IMAGE HERE) . Here we can see the numbers are set in an increasing order. Setting numbers in an increasing or decreasing is needed for a binary search . Binary search is started with the middle number first Middle number is found by taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two | . | Binary Search can be represented using a tree as shown below | . (IMAGE HERE) . . Heres an easy way to put it: . binary search fidns the desired element by continuously chopping the search area in half | say the element you are looking for is &#39;f&#39; | . [a b c d e f g h] . We would start in the middle at element &#39;d&#39; | becuase our target is greater than d we will eliminate everything left of &#39;d&#39; including &#39;d&#39; (chopping it in half) . [e f g h] is what now remains . again we would &#39;chop in half&#39; | say we iterate through &#39;g&#39; and &#39;h&#39;, our desired element is still not found so we would eliminate &#39;g; and &#39;h&#39; and continue the process | . [e f] . now we are down to 2 elements | &#39;chopping in half&#39; will give us our desired element | . [f] . | . def BinarySearch(array, x, low, high): # Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 # find the middle (taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two) if array[mid] == x: # if desired number is the middle is found return desired number (middle number) return mid elif array[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 array = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] x = 4 result = BinarySearch(array, x, 0, len(array)-1) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) . Element is present at index 1 . We have created a function called binary_search() function which takes two arguments - a list to be sorted and a number to be searched. . | We have declared two variables to store the lowest and highest values in the list. The lowest is assigned initial value to 0, the highest to len(list1) 1 and mid as 0. . | Next, we have declared the while loop with the condition that the lowest is equal and smaller than the highest. The while loop will iterate if the number has not been found yet. . | In the while loop, we find the mid value and compare the index value to the number we are searching for. . | If the value of the mid-index is smaller than n, we increase the mid value by 1 and assign it to the low. The search moves to the left side. . | Otherwise, if the value of mid index is larger than n, we decrease the mid value by 1 and assign it to the high. The search moves to the right side. . | If the n is equal to the mid value then return mid. . | This will happen until the low is equal and smaller than the high. . | If we reach at the end of the function, then the element is not present in the list. We return -1 to the calling function. . | . . Hacks . Using my example above and steps below, create your own iteration using binary search . Steps . Compare x with the middle element. | If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index. | Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half. | Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half. | .

This will output &quot;unusual&quot;, &quot;bold&quot;, &quot;away&quot; . Iteration . stuff . title:Iteration HW- toc: true | comments: true | categories: [iteration] | tags: [iteration] | . First, what not to do . Iteration is important for your time and sanity . print(&quot;alpha&quot;) print(&quot;bravo&quot;) print(&quot;charlie&quot;) print(&quot;delta&quot;) print(&quot;echo&quot;) print(&quot;foxtrot&quot;) print(&quot;golf&quot;) print(&quot;hotel&quot;) print(&quot;india&quot;) print(&quot;juliett&quot;) print(&quot;kilo&quot;) print(&quot;lima&quot;) print(&quot;mike&quot;) print(&quot;november&quot;) print(&quot;oscar&quot;) print(&quot;papa&quot;) print(&quot;quebec&quot;) print(&quot;romeo&quot;) print(&quot;sierra&quot;) print(&quot;tango&quot;) print(&quot;uniform&quot;) print(&quot;victor&quot;) print(&quot;whiskey&quot;) print(&quot;x-ray&quot;) print(&quot;yankee&quot;) print(&quot;zulu&quot;) #please help me . Coding all of these individually takes a lot of unnecessary time, how can we shorten this time? . Iteration . Iteration is the repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. There&#39;s a lot of types of iteration though, what to use? How do we apply iteration to lists? . Some methods include using a &quot;for loop&quot;, using a &quot;for loop and range()&quot;, using a &quot;while loop&quot;, and using comprehension . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable objects. They are the &#39;containers&#39; that store the data to iterate. . Each of these containers are able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration:definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met . for variable in iterable: statement() . Iterator? Iterable? Iteration? . When an object is iterable it can be used in an iteration | When passed through the function iter() it returns an iterator | Strings, lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are all examples of iterable objects. | . a = [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;bravo&#39;, &#39;charlie&#39;] itr = iter(a) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) . alpha bravo charlie . Loops . Well, above is basically just printing them again, so how do we takes these iterators into something we can make use for? | Loops take essentially what we did above and automates it, here are some examples. | . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # using a for loop for i in list: #for item in the list, print the item print(i) . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # Taking the length of the list lengthList = len(list) # Iteration using the amount of items in the list for i in range(lengthList): print(list[i]) . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # Once again, taking the length of the list lengthList = len(list) # Setting the variable we are going to use as 0 i=0 # Iteration using the while loop # Argument saying WHILE a certain variable is a certain condition, the code should run while i &lt; lengthList: print(list[i]) i += 1 . Using the range() function . But wait, there&#39;s more . Need to save even more time? The above is useful for many occasions, but can get tedious fast, in this case, use range() | . x = range(5) for n in x: print(n) . 0 1 2 3 4 . Else, elif, and break . For when 1 statement isn&#39;t enough . Else:when the condition does not meet, do statement()- Elif: when the condition does not meet, but meets another condition, do statement() | Break: stop the loop | . HW Iteration . Use the list below to turn the first letter of any word (using input()) into its respective NATO phonetic alphabet word . Ex: . list -&gt; . lima india sierra tango . words = [&quot;alfa&quot;, &quot;bravo&quot;, &quot;charlie&quot;, &quot;delta&quot;, &quot;echo&quot;, &quot;foxtrot&quot;, &quot;golf&quot;, &quot;hotel&quot;, &quot;india&quot;, &quot;juliett&quot;, &quot;kilo&quot;, &quot;lima&quot;, &quot;mike&quot;, &quot;november&quot;, &quot;oscar&quot;, &quot;papa&quot;, &quot;quebec&quot;, &quot;romeo&quot;, &quot;sierra&quot;, &quot;tango&quot;, &quot;uniform&quot;, &quot;victor&quot;, &quot;whiskey&quot;, &quot;xray&quot;, &quot;yankee&quot;, &quot;zulu&quot;] inp = input().lower() output = &quot;&quot; for letter in inp: for word in words: if letter == word[0]: output += word + &quot; &quot; print(inp + &quot; -&gt; n&quot; + output) . bruh bravo romeo uniform hotel . 2D Iteration . 2D Arrays . A 2D array is simply just a list of lists. The example below is technically correct but... . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Conventially 2D arrays are written like below. This is because 2D arrays are meant to be read in 2 dimensions (hence the name). Writing them like below makes them easier to visualize and understand. . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Printing a 2D Array . We already know that we can&#39;t just print the matrix by calling it. We need to iterate through it to print it. . def print_matrix1(matrix): for i in range(len(matrix)): # outer for loop. This runs on i which represents the row. range(len(matrix)) is in order to iterate through the length of the matrix for j in range(len(matrix[i])): # inner for loop. This runs on the length of the i&#39;th row in the matrix (j changes for each row with a different length) print(matrix[i][j], end=&quot; &quot;) # [i][j] is the 2D location of that value in the matrix, kinda like a coordinate pair. [i] iterates to the specific row and [j] iterates to the specific value in the row. end=&quot; &quot; changes the end value to space, not a new line. print() # prints extra line. this is in the outer loop, not the inner loop, because it only wants to print a new line for each row . print(&quot;Raw matrix (list of lists): &quot;) print(keypad) print(&quot;Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration:&quot;) print_matrix1(keypad) print() . Raw matrix (list of lists): [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&#39; &#39;, 0, &#39; &#39;]] Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . def print_matrix2(matrix): for row in matrix: # Iterates through each &quot;row&quot; of matrix. Row is a dummy variable, it could technically be anything. It iterates through each value of matrix and each value is it&#39;s own list. in this syntax the list is stored in &quot;row&quot;. for col in row: # Iterates through each value in row. Again col, column, is a dummy variable. Each value in row is stored in col. print(col, end=&quot; &quot;) # Same as 1 print() # Same as 1 print_matrix2(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . More Functions . Try to find another way to print the matrix. Only complete one of the two (unless you&#39;d like to do both). Below is a hint . fruit = [&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;bananas&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;] print(fruit) print(*fruit) # Python built in function: &quot;*&quot;. Figure out what it does . [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;bananas&#39;, &#39;grapes&#39;] apples bananas grapes . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] def print_matrix3(matrix): for i in matrix: print(*i) print_matrix3(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . Alternatively, find a way to print the matrix using the iter() function you already learned. Or use both! . def print_matrix4(matrix): code = &quot;your code goes here&quot; . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] . Print what month you were born and how old you are by iterating through the keyboard (don&#39;t just write a string). . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] print(str(keyboard[0][5]) + str(keyboard[3][9]) + str(keyboard[0][1]) + str(keyboard[0][2]) + str(keyboard[3][9]) + str(keyboard[0][2]) + str(keyboard[0][10]) + str(keyboard[0][10]) + str(keyboard[0][6]) + &quot; n&quot; + str(keyboard[0][1]) + str(keyboard[0][6])) . 5/12/2006 16 . Challenge . Change all of the letters that you DIDN&#39;T print above to spaces, &quot; &quot;, and then print the full keyboard. (the things you did print should remain in the same spot) . Alternative Challenge: If you would prefer, animate it using some form of delay so it flashes one of your letters at a time on the board in order and repeats. (this one may be slightly more intuitive) . DO NOT HARD CODE THIS. Don&#39;t make it harder on yourself, iterate through, make it abstract so it can be used dynamically. You should be able to input any string and your code should work. . . 1 6 R A H C M . If you get stuck you can just make a picture with an array and print it (I will grade based on how good it looks) . I do expect an attempt so write some code to show you tried the challenge. . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] for row in keyboard: for item in row: print(item, end = &quot; &quot;) print() . ` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - = Q W E R T Y U I O P [ ] A S D F G H J K L ; &#39; Z X C V B N M , . / . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] inp = input() for row in keyboard: for item in row: letterFound = True for letter in inp: if letter.lower() == item.lower(): print(letter.upper(), end = &quot; &quot;) else: letterFound = False if letterFound == False: print(&quot; &quot;, end = &quot; &quot;) print() # it kind of works:) . 1 2 3 .",

What is a boolean? . A data type with two possible values: true or false | . Boolean and Binary . So similar yet so different. . Boolean math and binary notation both use the same two ciphers: 1 and 0. | However, please note that Boolean quantities are restricted to a singlular bit (can only be either 1, or 0) | On the otherhand, binary numbers may be composed of many bits adding up in place-weighted form to any finite value, or size | . Must Knows . A Boolean value is either TRUE or FALSE | The AP Exam will provide you with a reference sheet with the operators below. | . . A few ways these operators could be used... | . . Relational Operators in action . How could you use operators to determine if the average of 5 grades is greater than 80? | . With the grades below, use a boolean expression to determine if the average grade is above an 80 and print the result (True or False) | Try it in as few steps as possible! | Be creative!

Logical Operators! . These types of operators don&#39;t necessarily deal with equivalent/non-equivalent values, but they rather work on operands to produce a singular boolean result . AND : returns TRUE if the operands around it are TRUE | OR : returns TRUE if at least one operand is TRUE | NOT : returns TRUE if the following boolean is FALSE | .

Lesson Overview: 3.6 - Conditionals . Focusing on Selection . Selection: uses a condition that evaluates to true or false . Selection determines which part of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false . Algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task . Conditional Statements . Also known as &quot;if statements&quot; . Can be seen as if statements or if blocks . . Can also be seen as if else statements or if else-blocks . x = 20 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) . x is greater than y . x = 20 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is not greater than y&quot;) . x is greater than y .

What is a boolean? . A data type with two possible values: true or false | . Boolean and Binary . So similar yet so different. . Boolean math and binary notation both use the same two ciphers: 1 and 0. | However, please note that Boolean quantities are restricted to a singlular bit (can only be either 1, or 0) | On the otherhand, binary numbers may be composed of many bits adding up in place-weighted form to any finite value, or size | . Must Knows . A Boolean value is either TRUE or FALSE | The AP Exam will provide you with a reference sheet with the operators below. | . . A few ways these operators could be used... | . . Relational Operators in action . How could you use operators to determine if the average of 5 grades is greater than 80? | . With the grades below, use a boolean expression to determine if the average grade is above an 80 and print the result (True or False) | Try it in as few steps as possible! | Be creative!

Lesson Overview: 3.6 - Conditionals . Focusing on Selection . Selection: uses a condition that evaluates to true or false . Selection determines which part of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false . Algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task . Conditional Statements . Also known as &quot;if statements&quot; . Can be seen as if statements or if blocks . . Can also be seen as if else statements or if else-blocks . x = 20 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) . x is greater than y . x = 20 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is not greater than y&quot;) . x is greater than y .

Pseudocode: A blend of human language and coding format. | Hacks: Jamboard Flowchart . Click on this link for a group activity . . . Arithmetic Operations . Arithmetic operations exist in most programming languages. . Basic Operations . Subtraction: . Represented by “-&quot; | . num1 = 2 - 1 . Addition: . Represented by &quot;+&quot; | . num1 = 2 + 1 . Multiplication: . Represented by “*” | . num1 = 2 * 1 . Division: . Represented by “/” | . num1 = 2 / 1 . Getting the Remainder: . Represented by “MOD” (% in python) | . num1 = 5 % 2 . Different Uses . Items can be numbers or variables. . Examples: . num1 = 10 num2 = num1 - 25 num3 = 100 * num1 num4 = num1 / num2 num5 = 9 % num4 . Order of Operations . Arithmetic operations in programming are performed in the same order as operations in mathematics: . Operations in parentheses should be done first. . | Division and multiplication should be done before addition and subtraction. . | Modulus works similar to multiplication and division. . | . Example: Evaluate num1 . num1 = 9 % 2 * ( 8 - 2 ) + 8 / ( 6 - 4 ) print(num1) . 10.0 . . . Variables . Different Ways Values are Stored in Variables .

A string is a collection of characters. What is a character as character can be anything from numbers + letters + spaces + special symbols + etc. . Certain procedures may be used with strings and they vary from programming language to language Python examples . len() to find the length of a string . lower() to convert to lowercase . etc. Pseudocode examples . len() returns the length of a string . concat() returns a string made up of the concatenated strings ex. concat(&quot;string1&quot; + &quot;string2&quot;) would return string1string2 . substring() returns the characters from the string beginning at the at the first position to the last so an example of this would be substring (&quot;abcdefghijk&quot; + 2 + 5) would print bcde (pseudocode starts at 1) . String Concatenation . What is string concatenation? . String concatenation is combining 2 or more strings to make a new strings in order to create a new string . concat() in pseudocode and varys from language to language can be used to combine to strings such as concat(&quot;cookie&quot; +&quot;monster&quot;) returns cookiemonster . Substrings . What is a substring? . A substring is a part of and already existing string. . In pseudocode substring() method is used for instance for concat(&quot;Mr.Mortenson is very handsome&quot; 1 + 2) the system would return Mr (remember that pseudocode starts at 1) . Hacks . Find the result of the following problems. Then convert the pseudocode to working python code using your knowledge of python string operators. . Problem 1 . Noun = &quot;Mr.Mortenson&quot; Adjective = &quot;handsome&quot; Adjective2 = &quot;Very&quot; Verb = &quot;is&quot; abrev = Noun[0:7] yoda = Adjective2 + &quot; &quot; + Adjective + &quot; &quot; + abrev + &quot; &quot; +Verb + &quot;.&quot; print(yoda) . Very handsome Mr.Mort is. . Problem 2 . cookie = &quot;choclate&quot; cookie2 = &quot;rasin&quot; len1 = len(cookie) / 2 len2 = len(cookie2) * 45 vote1 = str(cookie) + &quot; votes: &quot; + str(len2) vote2 = str(cookie2) + &quot; votes: &quot; + str(len1) votes = vote1 &quot; n&quot; + vote2 print(votes) . choclate votes: 225 rasin votes: 4.0 .",

Night at the Museum I only visited other periods of CSP and CSA (and Psych for other reasons), but I saw some pretty cool stuff, however I only took pictures before it started, of people&#39;s VSCode (because I thought it would be funny), and only took photos of two groups because I kind of forgot.

The answer is A because the application *would* need Brandon and Cynthia&#39;s usernames to find their dietary restrictions, but not of everyone on their contacts list. I don&#39;t really get this one. The answer isn&#39;t A because routing on the internet is usually dynamic, meaning that the order is not specified in advance. On this one I knew both A and D would work, but I didn&#39;t realize I was supposed to select multiple answers. The reason I went with D, however, is because it is what I would have done. | .",

In working primarily by ourselves on our own games, we will be more susceptible to running into problems, thus allowing for more learning opportunities | . | Is the project going to hold team members interest for 8 weeks? We like games, we like to code -&gt; coding + games = mega cool! | . | Does the project have potential for someone to use it beyond the 8 weeks? ie Customer or Sponsor needed?

Correct Answer (write it out, not just the letter!): . Social contact is essential to intellectual development . Why the correct answer is right (content based explanation): . Vygotsky’s theory about the zone of proximal development indicates that children learn from mentors or coaches. . Why your answer was wrong (re-word the q to make your wrong ans right): . Q: What did Albert Bandura suggest about the way children learn? . A: He said that children learn through observational learning, or imitation. . If your wrong answer cannot be made correct, just explain: . Children learn by imitating others was my incorrect choice, but Vygotsky is not the one who says this, this is more along the lines of what Albert Bandura’s theories suggest. .

Correct Answer (write it out, not just the letter!): . Hypnosis, imagination-enhancing techniques, and drug-induced recall. . Why the correct answer is right (content based explanation): . All of these techniques can implant false memories. Those with vivid imaginations were found to be more susceptible to “imagination inflation,” where repeatedly imagining nonexistent events creates false memories. Therefore, enhancing imagination would increase the amount of false memories. Drug-induced recall and hypnosis have been criticized heavily by psychologists, to the point of being agreed upon as unreliable by several large organizations. . Why your answer was wrong (re-word the q to make your wrong ans right): .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | .

You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
