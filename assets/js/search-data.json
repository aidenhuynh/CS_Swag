We are thinking of making a website that contains multiple different games, something like coolmathgames.com | Each person will be making their own game, and we will assist each other along the way | . | Are we considering a project that is best for our educational purpose? In working primarily by ourselves on our own games, we will be more susceptible to running into problems, thus allowing for more learning opportunities | . | Is the project going to hold team members interest for 8 weeks? We like games, we like to code -&gt; coding + games = mega cool! | . | Does the project have potential for someone to use it beyond the 8 weeks? ie Customer or Sponsor needed? People don&#39;t really need games but it might be fun to revisit now and then | . | Does the project have potential to be used for Create Performance Task submission? My game will be Tetris, which has potential for Create Performance Task submission as it uses data abstraction in the lists of possible tetricles | . | .",

Correct Answer (write it out, not just the letter!): . Social contact is essential to intellectual development . Why the correct answer is right (content based explanation): . Vygotsky’s theory about the zone of proximal development indicates that children learn from mentors or coaches. . Why your answer was wrong (re-word the q to make your wrong ans right): . Q: What did Albert Bandura suggest about the way children learn? . A: He said that children learn through observational learning, or imitation. . If your wrong answer cannot be made correct, just explain: . Children learn by imitating others was my incorrect choice, but Vygotsky is not the one who says this, this is more along the lines of what Albert Bandura’s theories suggest. .

Correct Answer (write it out, not just the letter!): . Hypnosis, imagination-enhancing techniques, and drug-induced recall. . Why the correct answer is right (content based explanation): . All of these techniques can implant false memories. Those with vivid imaginations were found to be more susceptible to “imagination inflation,” where repeatedly imagining nonexistent events creates false memories. Therefore, enhancing imagination would increase the amount of false memories. Drug-induced recall and hypnosis have been criticized heavily by psychologists, to the point of being agreed upon as unreliable by several large organizations. . Why your answer was wrong (re-word the q to make your wrong ans right): . What psychotherapy practice(?) used by professional therapists are highly likely to promote the construction of false memories? . If your wrong answer cannot be made correct, just explain: .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon.

Note: A doc link to an example website: fast.ai should also work fine. . Footnotes . You can have footnotes in notebooks, however the syntax is different compared to markdown documents. This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} . For example, here is a footnote 1. . And another 2 . 1. This is the footnote.↩ . 2. This is the other footnote. You can even have a link!↩ .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
